# Env App (env details UI over Flowersec E2EE)

This document describes the **Env App** implementation in the Redeven runtime.

Key points:

- The Env App UI is **runtime-bundled** (built + embedded into the Redeven runtime binary).
- The browser accesses it over a **Flowersec E2EE proxy** (runtime mode).
- Env details features live here (Deck/Terminal/Monitor/File Browser/Codespaces/Ports/Flower/Codex/Notes overlay).
- Notes overlay now consumes the released shared floe-webapp Notes surface (`@floegence/floe-webapp-core/notes`); Redeven keeps snapshot fetch, API mutations, SSE projection, and controller glue as the product-owned runtime layer.
- Notes overlay shell integration is also product-owned: Env App measures the shell-safe workspace viewport (the shared sidebar + main surface, excluding top bar / activity bar / bottom bar / terminal panel) and publishes a small body-level CSS geometry contract so the shared Notes overlay plus its body-portal flyouts/backdrops stay inside the actual workspace area instead of the raw desktop window viewport.
- Notes overlay keyboard ownership is split deliberately: shared floe-webapp Notes now owns note numbering, overlay-wide digit-to-copy capture, copied-state feedback, and related toasts, while Env App forwards only its single shell-owned Notes toggle keybind (`mod+.`) into the shared floating allowlist so the overlay can still close after canvas or note interactions without reopening the rest of the shell hotkey surface.
- Monitor `Top Processes` severity coloring is semantic and threshold-driven: CPU uses muted/success/warning/error tiers at `<20`, `20-49.9`, `50-99.9`, and `>=100`, while memory uses muted/success/warning tiers at `<1 GiB`, `1-9.9 GiB`, and `>=10 GiB`.
- In Redeven Desktop, the command palette also exposes a shell-owned `Open Environment...` action through the Desktop browser bridge; that action stays separate from runtime settings ownership.
- In Redeven Desktop, Env App also follows a shell-owned theme contract: Electron main resolves `system` / `light` / `dark`, preload exposes `window.redevenDesktopTheme`, and Env App routes only its Floe `theme` persistence key through that shell bridge while leaving other UI persistence in the normal Env App namespace.
- Desktop theme changes triggered from Env App must update the current document theme, native window chrome, and detached child windows together instead of leaving Env App as an independent theme authority.
- Runtime Settings uses an explicit information architecture so users can find endpoint controls by intent rather than by implementation detail:
  - `Overview`: `Config File`, `Connection`, `Runtime Status`
  - `Runtime Configuration`: `Shell & Workspace`, `Logging`
  - `Codespaces & Tooling`: `code-server Runtime`, `Codespaces Ports`
  - `Security`: `Permission Policy`
  - `AI & Extensions`: `Flower`, `Skills`, `Codex`
  - `Diagnostics`: `Debug Console`
- Codex is a separate optional AI runtime with its own activity-bar entry and gateway namespace; it is not implemented as a Flower mode, provider, or sub-page.
- Runtime Settings -> `AI & Extensions` -> Codex is a read-only host/runtime status panel. Redeven does not persist Codex approval, sandbox, model, or binary configuration in runtime settings.
- The Codex sidebar/page use floe-webapp layout and form primitives for visual consistency, but Codex state, icon assets, thread navigation, transcript projection, and request handling stay implemented as a separate surface rather than as Flower extensions.
- Shared highlight/callout visuals should continue to flow from released floe-webapp tokens. The product-owned Env App must not re-theme generic accent tokens just to deepen `HighlightBlock`, because that would recouple unrelated shared primitives.
- The Codex surface is structured as a dedicated conversation navigator plus chat shell, intentionally following the same high-level sidebar + transcript + bottom composer rhythm as Flower while keeping the implementation fully Codex-local.
- The top-left Redeven brand mark is a product-owned shell slot rather than a generic top-bar icon action: the visible logo stays on the shared shell's 24px logo centerline so it aligns with desktop `ActivityBar` icons, while the clickable target is expanded locally instead of shifting shared shell padding or navigation geometry.
- On desktop, crossing between full-screen tabs and the Flower/Codex conversation surfaces opens or closes the shell-owned conversations sidebar instantly, while explicit re-click collapse/reopen on the already-active Flower/Codex activity item keeps the normal smooth sidebar animation; mobile behavior stays unchanged.
- When host Codex is missing, the Codex surface remains navigable for diagnostics, but host-backed actions inside the surface switch into an explicitly disabled state with a shared reason instead of pretending a new chat can still start.
- The Codex chat shell now reads a Codex-only capability snapshot from the gateway (`/_redeven_proxy/api/codex/capabilities`) so the composer can expose host-valid model, reasoning-effort, approval, and sandbox controls without borrowing Flower runtime state.
- Codex composer controls stay below the chat input and remain scoped to `src/ui/codex/*` selectors only, so mobile-density, sidebar stability, and transcript alignment updates do not affect Flower page styling or logic.
- Codex visual styling is intentionally flat and workstation-like: `src/ui/codex/codex.css` owns a Codex-local semantic surface token family and Codex-scoped overrides for inherited shared chat selectors, while decorative gradients and radial highlights are intentionally excluded from the Codex chat page.
- Codex transcript evidence keeps its data adaptation local, but file-change rows now hand the synthesized patch over to the shared Git patch viewer surface so Codex and Git browser diff bodies stay on the same theme contract; reasoning / plan rows still start collapsed while preserving per-item disclosure state across streaming updates.
- Codex branding now hardens its runtime icon path by preferring bundled artwork and falling back to an inline glyph, so embedded Env App builds never show a browser broken-image placeholder.
- Codex markdown keeps the existing standard-link and local-file-reference DOM structure, preserves local file-reference labels that include embedded line anchors such as `CODEX_UI.md#L121`, and consumes the shared floe-webapp file-reference chip styling instead of maintaining a Codex-only outline variant.
- Env App owns a root-scoped paired surface/stroke theme contract: `--redeven-surface-panel*` defines the standard light/dark panel family, matching `--redeven-stroke-*` tokens define panel, overlay, control, and divider borders, and shared `card` / `popover` surfaces plus Flower chat consume that same contract so body portals and in-tree panels stay visually aligned.
- Flower chat keeps model-picking scope explicit: the draft chat picker updates the default model for future new chats, active unlocked threads edit only their own thread model, and locked threads show a read-only model badge instead of a misleading editable control.
- Flower thread history keeps the chat `title` separate from the latest `last_message_preview` snippet: untitled chats render as `New chat` until the runtime later writes a generated title, while the preview line continues to reflect the newest visible message text.
- Flower thread runtime metadata also records `last_context_run_id`, letting completed chats recover the latest context summary without depending on transient live-run state in the current page session.
- Flower auto titles are best-effort but resilient: the runtime retries transient generation failures in the background, can expand the title-generation output budget once for reasoning-heavy models, falls back to a truncated first user message after three failed generation passes, and also recovers recent untitled threads after restart, so users should see a usable title appear without manual refresh or rename in normal cases.
- File Browser keeps Monaco as the single text surface for both preview and edit, so read-only and editable text/code views stay visually and behaviorally aligned without branching on syntax-support gaps.
- File Browser directory switches are atomically committed inside the product-owned `RemoteFileBrowser` shell: user navigation revalidates the requested target directory before the rendered path changes, cached ancestors may still seed the next tree for responsiveness, explicit refresh force-reloads the current directory, and invalid targets recover to the nearest existing ancestor without showing an intermediate empty browser shell.
- File Browser path entry also stays product-owned in that same shell: the toolbar path slot can temporarily switch from breadcrumb mode into a `Go to path` input, explicit manual entry validates the exact requested target before commit, and invalid manual targets stay in the input with inline feedback instead of reusing the ancestor-fallback recovery path reserved for delete/rename drift and refresh recovery.
- File Browser now treats directory context menus as explicit directory targets rather than inferring everything from selected file rows: directory rows and blank workspace background both expose directory-scoped helper actions, while file and mixed-selection menus intentionally keep `New` hidden.
- File Browser directory actions now expose `New -> File` and `New -> Folder` from both directory rows and blank workspace background menus; blank background menus also keep `Ask Flower` and `Open in Terminal` scoped to the current directory.
- File Browser directory creation now uses a dedicated `fs.mkdir` RPC instead of overloading `fs.writeFile`, and successful create actions only mutate loaded tree branches while still updating cached directory entries for later navigation.
- File Browser create flows now also reveal the new entry after success: when the target parent is already visible the list scrolls the new item into view and applies the existing selected state immediately, and when creation starts from a different directory row the shell first revalidates/navigation-switches into that parent before consuming the shared reveal request.
- File Browser treats symbolic links as first-class entries instead of flattening them into plain files or plain directories: directory links stay navigable, file links keep file-preview behavior, broken links stay visible with explicit unavailable handling, and dedicated upstream iconography distinguishes them from normal entries across the browser surfaces.
- When a supported code file switches from read-only preview into Edit mode, Env App intentionally remounts the Monaco instance instead of only flipping `readOnly`; this lifecycle boundary prevents stale preview state from leaking into editability.
- If Monaco cannot start while the user is entering Edit mode, Env App shows an explicit editor-unavailable state instead of silently dropping back to a fake editable fallback.
- When the environment grants `can_write`, text previews can switch into Monaco-backed edit mode and save changes back through the runtime file RPC.
- `fs/read_file` is file-only by contract: the UI blocks directory-like symbolic links before preview, and the runtime stream still rejects any directory target (including directory symlinks) with an explicit domain error instead of surfacing a transport-layer `EOF`.
- File Browser directory context menus can hand off into Terminal by opening the terminal page and creating a new session rooted at the selected directory.
- Terminal session creation is dormant-first: `createSession` records the logical session, the first terminal attach starts the PTY with the measured viewport, and the terminal surface performs one explicit post-attach resize confirmation after mount so remote size converges to the settled visible viewport instead of a provisional fallback.
- Terminal size handoff is focus-driven after attach: when multiple surfaces can reopen the same session, only the focused surface is allowed to emit remote resize updates, and regaining focus re-fits plus re-emits the settled viewport so the active surface can reclaim remote PTY ownership from a previously active narrower or wider surface.
- Terminal output can hand off back into the shared floating file preview through modifier-click file links. Path resolution is terminal-session-aware, so relative paths use the live working directory and `~/...` uses the runtime home path before opening preview.
- Terminal tabs now use shell-integration status chrome instead of a textual attention prefix: command start still lights a compact spinner immediately, long-running interactive tools keep that spinner only while fresh background output is actively arriving, quiet background tabs decay to an unread dot after unseen activity, bell events stay dot-only without a bell toast, and reopening the tab clears the unread marker.
- Terminal shell integration also publishes the live working directory explicitly at prompt-ready time through `OSC 633;P;Cwd=<absolute-path>`, so `cd`-driven tab renames, file-link resolution, and terminal-to-browser handoffs all stay aligned without inferring cwd from generic terminal title changes; the running/unread chrome still stays driven by the existing `A/B/D` plus `RedevenActivity` markers.
- Codespaces cards can hand off from their right-click menu into Terminal and Ask Flower, reusing the same directory-level actions used by File Browser folders.
- Terminal right-click menus can hand off back into File Browser by opening the shared floating browser surface at the active terminal working directory.
- Env App right-click menus that expose cross-surface handoff actions keep a shared priority order: `Ask Flower` first, `Open in Terminal` second when present, `Browse files` next when present, then a separator before any remaining actions.
- Git browser cards now follow the same helper-action ordering where it makes semantic sense: `Changes` exposes `Ask Flower`, `Open in Terminal`, and `Browse Files`; `Branches` exposes directory handoffs only when the selected branch resolves to a checked-out worktree; `Graph` exposes commit-scoped `Ask Flower` plus `Switch --detach here`, branch-history commit detail exposes the same detach action, and detached repository chrome now shows explicit `Detached HEAD` state plus a one-click `Checkout <branch>` action back to the latest attached local branch when checkout history can resolve one safely.
- `Branches` also keeps its branch-detail chrome intentionally compact: empty branch summaries are omitted instead of reserving placeholder space, branch subview tabs key off the measured branch-header container width so narrow content panes get a dedicated row while wider panes realign to the branch header's right edge without collapsing the workspace/action rail into that same row, workspace/actions controls wrap in self-contained groups so labels never detach from their buttons, and the status-section picker stays a segmented strip so the changed-file table reaches the viewport sooner.
- Git browser title dots are a semantic chrome contract rather than ad-hoc Tailwind background utilities: `src/ui/widgets/GitChrome.ts` maps `GitChromeTone` to stable `git-tone-dot--*` classes, while `src/styles/redeven.css` owns the final light/dark pigment tokens so runtime-bundled production CSS cannot silently drop those markers.
- Git stash is implemented as one shared floating Git surface instead of a fourth top-level browse mode: the header `Stashes` badge opens the saved-stack review tab, `Changes` and `Branches -> Status` open the save tab for the correct worktree target, and merge blockers can deep-link directly into `Stash current changes` when structured blocker data says the workspace can be stashed.
- Git collection RPCs now keep file lists metadata-only; the UI resolves selected file patches lazily through a single `getDiffContent` contract instead of embedding `patch_text` into workspace, compare, commit, or stash collection payloads.
- Large Git file tables use shared virtualization in the Env App (`Changes`, `Branches -> Compare`, `Branches -> Status`, `Graph` commit files, and stash changed-file review), while stash review stays summary-first and opens single-file diffs through the shared dialog flow on demand.
- CSS, HTML, SCSS, Less, TOML, Makefile-family files, Vue/Svelte-class files, and other text formats now stay on the same Monaco-backed preview/edit path instead of splitting by language support tables.
- File preview no longer uses a separate Shiki renderer. The only remaining preview fallbacks are a plain-text truncated view and a plain-text emergency view when Monaco fails outside edit mode.
- Desktop-managed runs can still promote selected serializable overlay surfaces into dedicated desktop child windows by reopening the same Env App entrypoint in a detached-scene mode (`file_preview` and `debug_console` today); shared file-browser entry points stay on the in-page floating browser surface instead of opening a second desktop window.
- The page browser, Ask Flower linked-directory browser, Flower chat floating browser, Codex transcript browser, and explicit detached file-browser scene all reuse the same `RemoteFileBrowser` surface; product-specific code only owns the shell behavior that opens it.
- Codex transcript now reuses that same floating browser shell as well, seeded from the resolved Codex working directory instead of introducing a Codex-specific file-browser surface.
- Env App now keeps the reusable chat/terminal/Codex floating browser shell at the root level, so cross-surface entry points share the same floating-window persistence, explicit browser-seed handling, and `RemoteFileBrowser` rendering path; file preview keeps detached desktop promotion separately.

## Notes overlay

Env App now exposes a product-owned **Notes overlay** that floats above the current workspace instead of introducing a new top-level activity page.

- Notes opens from the shell top bar and closes from a dedicated top-right close button inside the overlay.
- Notes also exposes a shell-level `Cmd/Ctrl+.` command so users can open or dismiss the overlay without leaving the current workspace flow, even while typing in another editor/input.
- Opening the overlay does not auto-focus an editor field; users can keep their current input focus until they explicitly create or edit a note.
- Env App enables the shared floe-webapp Notes surface in `interactionMode="floating"`, so the overlay stays non-modal over the current workspace instead of trapping focus like a settings dialog.
- On pages that keep the shell conversation sidebar visible, Notes still spans the full workspace viewport (`sidebar + main`) instead of shrinking to the main pane only.
- In floating mode, `Escape` dismisses the full overlay when focus is outside the Notes surface, and clicking outside the Notes-owned surface also dismisses the overlay without swallowing the underlying click target.
- A fresh Notes runtime boots with a default `Welcome` topic and one welcome note so first-time users land in a useful board instead of an empty shell.
- The overlay keeps a narrow topic rail with product-owned animal icons, inline rename/delete actions, and compact counts for live notes plus trash.
- Each topic renders on an infinite-style pan/zoom board:
  - wheel zooms around the cursor;
  - dragging the canvas or a note pans the board;
  - clicking a note without dragging copies the full note body and promotes that note to the top z-layer;
  - right-click (or long-press on touch) opens a Notes-specific context menu instead of the browser/system menu.
- Notes persist semantic style DSL fields (`style_version`, `color_token`, `size_bucket`) in the runtime so different Env App clients render the same card size/color footprint.
- Note preview size is derived from text length and capped to five stable size buckets; the card preview intentionally truncates large note bodies instead of expanding arbitrarily.
- Deleting a note moves it into a runtime-managed trash area with a fixed 72-hour retention window. Trash opens as a floating panel from the bottom-right dock icon, groups deleted notes by topic, preserves original color/size/coordinates for restore, supports per-topic clear, and also supports per-note `Delete now` for items already in trash.
- Notes state is runtime-authoritative: Env App fetches a snapshot from `/_redeven_proxy/api/notes/snapshot`, subscribes to ordered SSE updates from `/_redeven_proxy/api/notes/events`, and projects the same ordered topic/note/trash stream into every connected client.
- Runtime trash deletion semantics stay explicit:
  - `DELETE /_redeven_proxy/api/notes/items/:note_id` moves an active note into trash and emits `item.deleted`.
  - `DELETE /_redeven_proxy/api/notes/trash/items/:note_id` permanently removes one trashed note and emits `item.removed`.
  - `DELETE /_redeven_proxy/api/notes/trash/topics/:topic_id` clears all trashed notes for one topic and emits `trash.topic_cleared`.
  - When the last trashed note of a deleted topic is permanently removed, the runtime removes that deleted topic row as part of the same ordered event flow.

## Accessibility baseline

Env App targets a WCAG 2.2 AA baseline. The implementation follows an upstream-first split:

- Shared shell landmarks, skip-link behavior, main-region targeting, dropdown semantics, and generic tab behavior come from released `@floegence/floe-webapp-*` packages.
- Redeven-specific code only handles product-owned surfaces such as the local access gate, AI sidebar, custom tool blocks, git widgets, terminal integration, and file-browser composition.
- Product-owned file-browser composition is also responsible for cross-surface handoffs such as `Open in Terminal` for a selected directory; shared file-browser primitives still only provide generic menu/rendering behavior.
- The shared floating browser host is also product-owned because it coordinates terminal/chat entry points, desktop browser presentation policy, and browser-path seeding on top of the generic `RemoteFileBrowser` surface.

Contributor rules for this surface:

- Prefer upstream primitives and contracts over page-level ARIA patching.
- When a product-owned surface needs panel, overlay, control, segmented, or divider styling, use the local semantic Env App surface/stroke contract instead of raw `border-border/*` tuning in page code.
- Custom file-browser compositions that bypass the standard `FileBrowser` wrapper must mount `FileBrowserDragPreview` from `@floegence/floe-webapp-core/file-browser` whenever drag and drop stays enabled, so the shared drag affordance remains visible.
- Use real buttons, inputs, fieldsets, tabs, and panels for interactive behavior. Do not nest interactive elements.
- Keep visible focus indicators intact. Do not suppress focus rings on terminal, file, or chat surfaces without providing an equally visible replacement.
- When a control behaves like tabs, it must implement tab semantics completely, including roving `tabindex`, arrow key handling, and `aria-controls` / `aria-labelledby` pairing.
- Status and validation feedback should be programmatically associated with the relevant control, and blocking failures should move focus to the surfaced error or recovery target.

Current product-specific accessibility contract:

- The access gate uses explicit labels, help text, error associations, and focused recovery after unlock failures.
- AI thread rows keep thread selection and deletion as separate buttons instead of nested interactive content.
- Tool-call disclosures use a dedicated disclosure button, stable controlled content IDs, and separate approval actions. Web-search domain filters are grouped toggle buttons rather than fake tabs.
- Git view switching and branch subviews use keyboard-complete tablists with roving focus.
- The terminal surface keeps a visible focus treatment. Product-owned terminal, Ask Flower composer, and file-browser controls were audited during this work and intentionally kept on their existing semantic button/input patterns.

## Git browse worktree status

Git browse mode distinguishes between the active repository workspace and per-branch checked-out worktrees:

- The top-level `Changes` view shows the workspace state for the active repository root.
- `Branches -> Status` resolves its own workspace snapshot from an explicit checked-out repository root instead of reusing cached data from `Changes`.
- `Changes` is the shared user-facing pending-work category in both places, so `unstaged` and `untracked` entries are grouped together there while row-level metadata still keeps the original Git section visible.
- Workspace rows are now fetched through section-scoped pagination rather than one eager full-workspace snapshot:
  `Changes` pages over `unstaged + untracked`, `Staged` pages over the index snapshot, and `Conflicted` pages over merge-conflict entries.
- Repository summary remains the lightweight source of truth for workspace counts, while each visible section loads only its current page window and can append more rows on demand.
- Manual `Changes` refresh now reloads the visible section in place while invalidating the hidden section caches, so the current table does not fall into a duplicate reload race and later section switches still fetch fresh data.
- `Branches` intentionally keeps its sidebar list as a cached snapshot for responsiveness, but branch detail is now target-truthful: selecting a branch revalidates the requested ref against a fresh `git.listBranches` snapshot before `Status` or `History` is allowed to load.
- If another process deletes the selected branch, Redeven keeps the user anchored on the requested branch identity and renders an explicit stale-selection state with recovery actions (`Refresh branches`, `View current branch`) instead of hanging on a generic loading state or silently jumping selection.
- If branch status/history detail fails after selection because the ref or linked worktree vanished mid-flight, the browser re-runs the same branch reconciliation path so both pre-load and mid-load disappearance collapse into one consistent UX contract.
- For the current branch, branch status uses the active repository root.
- For a linked local branch, branch status uses the branch `worktreePath`.
- For remote branches or local branches without a checked-out worktree, branch status stays unavailable and the UI points users to `Compare` or to opening the branch in a worktree.
- Git browse `Ask Flower` entry points use Git-authored snapshot context instead of pretending commit or workspace summaries are file-browser selections, so Flower receives a clean summary of the selected workspace section or commit metadata/file list.
- Workspace, compare, and commit detail collection RPCs return metadata-only file summaries. Inline diff text is retrieved only when the user opens a specific file dialog, using `getDiffContent` for preview or full-context mode.
- Git diff dialogs keep the embedded `Patch` preview as the default fast path, expose an on-demand `Full Context` mode that re-fetches a single selected file diff with unchanged lines included for broader review context, treat a selected file as an explicit `loading` / `ready` / `error` / `unavailable` state instead of briefly reusing the generic empty-selection copy, and keep selected-file request ownership stable across equivalent parent rerenders.
- Merge commit browsing now uses an explicit first-parent contract for both commit changed-file listings and single-file commit diffs, so every file shown in `Files in Commit` stays openable in `Commit Diff` without relying on repository-local Git merge diff defaults.
- Large Git file tables render through a shared fixed-row virtual table, and the browser no longer downloads metadata for every workspace row up front, so repositories with very large change sets stay responsive.
- Git branch deletion keeps `safe delete` as the default path, but when an unmerged local branch cannot be safely deleted the review dialog can escalate into an exact branch-name-confirmed `force delete`; linked worktrees are force-removed together with their pending changes, while inaccessible linked worktrees remain blocked.

This keeps worktree status consistent even when the user opens `Branches` first without visiting `Changes`.

## Desktop Shell Theme Integration

When Env App runs inside Redeven Desktop, theme ownership stays in the Electron shell rather than in Env App page state.

Contract:

- Env App reads the current shell snapshot from `window.redevenDesktopTheme`.
- Floe `defaultTheme` comes from the shell snapshot source, not from an Env App-only local default.
- The Env App storage adapter intercepts only the persisted Floe `theme` key and maps it onto the shell bridge:
  - `getItem(theme-key)` returns the shell source
  - `setItem(theme-key, ...)` updates the shell source
  - `removeItem(theme-key)` resets the shell source to `system`
- All non-theme UI persistence such as layout and deck state remains owned by the existing Env App storage namespace.
- A small runtime subscription keeps `useTheme()` synchronized when Electron main rebroadcasts a new snapshot, including OS theme changes while the user preference is `system`.
- Env App keeps an explicit entry-document fallback on `html`, `body`, and `#root` so the shell-owned native window background and the first renderer frame stay aligned before feature surfaces mount.

Implications:

- Env App theme toggles behave like shell-wide toggles, not page-local overrides.
- Detached desktop child windows inherit the same theme snapshot and document-class synchronization path as the main Env App window.
- Eliminating independent page authority for native window colors avoids light flashes during dark-mode open, close, and aggressive resize transitions.
- Renderer CSS may still use richer theme tokens, but native window colors remain a shell-owned hex contract instead of flowing arbitrary CSS color syntax back into Electron.

## Detached Desktop Window Frame

Detached desktop child windows no longer mount business content directly against the document origin.

Contract:

- `DetachedSurfaceScene` maps each detached surface into a shared frame model with `title`, `subtitle`, `headerActions`, `body`, and optional `footer`.
- `DesktopDetachedWindowFrame` owns the chrome-safe titlebar reservation and consumes the shell-published titlebar hooks instead of re-deriving per-platform spacing inside scene components.
- File preview uses that shared frame header for file identity plus copy/edit/save/discard actions, while `FilePreviewContent` switches into a content-only mode for detached native windows.
- Debug Console also plugs into that shared frame, but keeps its request/trace/UI-performance content inside the detached child window so page dialogs and floating windows never cover it in desktop-managed sessions.
- Detached file browser keeps its existing workspace behavior, but now starts below the shared frame instead of assuming the page can render at the top edge of the document.

Implications:

- Future detached desktop surfaces should plug content into the shared frame rather than writing a new top-level window layout.
- Native control avoidance stays centralized in desktop preload + shared renderer frame code instead of scattering padding fixes across individual features.

## Git browse stash workflow

Git stash stays a workflow overlay owned by Git browse rather than a separate primary navigation mode:

- Desktop uses the shared floating `PreviewWindow`; mobile reuses the same surface as a full-screen dialog.
- The header `Stashes` action opens the `Saved Stashes` tab and shows the current stash count badge from repository summary data.
- `Changes -> Stash...` targets the active repository root.
- `Branches -> Status -> Stash...` targets the selected checked-out branch worktree (`worktreePath` when present, otherwise the active repository root for the current branch).
- Merge review blockers no longer rely on message parsing. The merge preview returns structured blocker metadata, and the dialog only shows `Stash current changes` when the blocker explicitly exposes a stashable workspace path.
- The `Save Changes` tab boots from repository summary data only. It reads workspace counts from `workspaceSummary` and does not preload the full workspace file list before the user decides to stash.

The stash surface itself is split into two tabs:

- `Save Changes` shows the target repository/worktree context, current workspace summary, optional stash message, and explicit `Include untracked files` / `Keep staged changes ready to commit` options.
- `Saved Stashes` shows a lightweight shared stash summary list first, then loads metadata-only detail for the selected stash, a compact changed-files table, and guarded actions for `Apply`, `Apply & Remove`, and `Delete`.
- Stash detail returns file metadata first; clicking a changed file opens the shared `GitDiffDialog`, which fetches `getDiffContent` lazily for preview/full-context review instead of forcing an inline patch split inside the stash surface.

Safety and refresh behavior:

- Stash entries use the stash commit OID as their stable identity, so selection survives index shifts like `stash@{0}` changing after new saves or deletions.
- `Apply` and `Delete` both require preview fingerprints before mutation; stale plans are rejected. `Delete` uses a dedicated confirmation dialog so the second step stays visible even when the stash detail panel is scrolled, and it refreshes the stash context when the plan goes stale so the user can confirm again without manually reopening the stash window.
- Desktop floating-window-owned confirmations such as stash delete and file-preview discard now use a window-scoped modal layer. The backdrop and confirmation content stay inside the owning floating window instead of dropping into the global page dialog stack.
- Stash apply preview simulates the operation in a temporary detached worktree before enabling confirmation, so clean-apply checks do not depend on string heuristics in the visible worktree.
- After stash mutations, the stash window refreshes its own target worktree context, while the main Git browser refreshes repository summary plus the currently active paged workspace section instead of forcing a full workspace reload or switching to the wrong worktree root.

## What runs where

Browser side:

- A sandbox bootstrap window (`env-<env_id>.<region>.<base-sandbox-domain>`, for example `env-demo.dev.redeven-sandbox.test`) creates a runtime-mode proxy:
  - A Service Worker forwards `fetch()` to the proxy runtime via `postMessage + MessageChannel`.
  - The runtime forwards HTTP/WS traffic over Flowersec E2EE to the Redeven runtime.
- The bootstrap then loads the Env App UI via a same-origin iframe:
  - `/_redeven_proxy/env/`
- This same-origin iframe pattern is specific to the trusted Env App origin.
  - When that iframe is hosted inside Redeven Desktop remote sessions, Env App publishes desktop drag-region rectangles for its header, while the Desktop session preload in the top-level document owns the actual native drag overlays.
  - Codespace and port-forward windows opened from Env App use a different path:
    `cs-*` / `pf-*` trusted launcher -> `rt-*` controller origin -> `app-*` untrusted app origin.
  - The untrusted app never runs on the same origin as the Env App runtime/controller window.

Runtime side:

- The runtime serves Env App static assets under `/_redeven_proxy/env/*` via the local gateway.
- The per-session local access proxy must preserve the browser-visible external origin context (`Host` / projected scheme / browser `Origin`) when forwarding to the gateway.
- Session binding for gateway APIs is carried on a trusted runtime-local hop (`X-Redeven-Session-Channel`) instead of overloading the browser-visible sandbox host labels.
- The Env App UI talks to the runtime using **Flowersec RPC/streams** (fs/terminal/monitor domains).
- Codex uses a separate browser-facing gateway contract under `/_redeven_proxy/api/codex/*`; the browser never connects directly to `codex app-server`, and the runtime resolves the host `codex` binary on demand instead of mirroring Codex runtime defaults into `config.json`.
- Codex transcript scrolling uses an explicit follow-bottom controller: thread switches and sends re-enter follow mode, late transcript reflow keeps the viewport at the latest output while following, and manual user scroll-away pauses bottom following until the user returns near the bottom or triggers a new explicit bottom intent.
- Codex-only bottom intents are split by semantics: system restore paths (`bootstrap`, `thread_switch`) stay instant, while explicit user intents (`send`, manual return-to-bottom) may animate smoothly when reduced motion is not requested.
- The Codex controller follows the real bottom scroll target (`scrollHeight - clientHeight`) and keeps this behavior scoped to the Codex surface, so Flower and other Env App pages do not inherit the motion change.
- Flower assistant live rendering strictly separates the settled transcript from the in-flight assistant surface. Persisted transcript rows stay in the virtualized message list, while the active assistant run renders through one dedicated non-virtualized tail surface inside the same scroll container until transcript persistence catches up.
- Flower assistant live output no longer creates synthetic pending transcript messages, transient display rows, or frontend-only message-id adoption. Empty output, hidden-only `thinking`, visible answer text, recovery snapshots, and terminal handoff are inner states of the same mounted live surface.
- Flower assistant live output keeps `thinking` hidden from the default transcript view. Before transcript persistence catches up, visible live answer text may render inline as live content; settled markdown rendering remains a transcript concern once the canonical assistant message lands.
- Active-run snapshots are recovery-only input for the live assistant tail. If the persisted transcript already contains the same assistant `message.id`, the UI must suppress the live tail and rely on the settled transcript row only.
- Run progress is shown on the active live assistant tail through the message ornament contract. The ornament component and avatar shell must stay stably mounted across streaming deltas so the UI does not flash while the phase label updates.
- Transcript-only affordances such as message timestamps and copy actions stay attached to settled transcript messages. The live assistant tail hides those footer actions until the canonical transcript row replaces it.
- Follow-bottom and virtualization operate on transcript rows only. Live-tail growth can still move the scroll height, but it must not mutate the virtual row-height cache or force transcript row remounts during streaming.
- Flower follow-bottom uses motion-aware intents: explicit user bottom intents such as send/return-to-bottom may animate into the latest output, while system restore paths such as thread switch, refresh bootstrap, transcript reset, and baseline recovery must stay instant.
- Flower's Env App composer now uses a transparent bottom-dock shell plus a centered floating card surface instead of a solid footer panel, but it still remains in normal document flow rather than covering the transcript.
- Flower transcript clearance for that floating composer is measured from the real bottom-dock height and written back into the transcript inset contract, so autosizing textareas, attachment strips, pending-input rails, and mobile safe-area changes cannot hide the newest visible transcript output under the composer.
- Detached desktop child windows keep using the same Env App runtime, access gate, and Flowersec protocol path; only the scene rendered inside the window changes.
- Terminal initializes new users with the `Dark` color theme and `Monaco` font while still preserving any saved per-user overrides.
- On mobile, Terminal defaults to the built-in Floe keyboard, keeps taps from auto-triggering the system IME in Floe mode, and offers suggestion rails for recent commands, common commands, scripts, and paths. The default mobile input mode is chosen in Terminal settings as a strict `Floe Keyboard` / `System IME` toggle, while the More menu only exposes temporary show/hide actions when Floe Keyboard mode is active. Floe Keyboard stays as a bottom overlay, the terminal viewport aligns itself to the measured keyboard inset instead of reserving a separate blank spacer above it, and vertical touch drags on the terminal surface are translated into native terminal scrolling on mobile.

## Session bootstrap flow used by the Env App UI

The Env App UI runs on sandbox origins and uses the Redeven session-bootstrap flow:

- Portal issues a one-time `boot_ticket` for Env App startup.
- Sandbox bootstrap exchanges `boot_ticket` for an HttpOnly `env_session` cookie.
- Env App uses `env_session` to mint one-time `entry_ticket` values on demand.
- `entry_ticket` is then redeemed for a canonical `connect_artifact`, and Flowersec uses the embedded tunnel grant to establish the runtime session.
- The shared browser bootstrap helper layer for artifact fetching, reconnect config assembly, and default `proxy.runtime` scope validation is now consumed from released `@floegence/floe-webapp-boot`; Redeven keeps runtime preflight, Local UI direct artifacts, access resume, and recovery UX as product-owned logic.
- In Local UI mode, the browser still uses the same canonical shape: Local UI mints a direct-transport `connect_artifact`, and the Env App reconnect contract stays artifact-first even though the underlying transport is direct instead of tunnel.

Security baseline:

- Env App UI never stores long-lived capability credentials in browser storage.
- High-value credentials are HttpOnly cookies scoped to the sandbox origin.
- One-time `entry_ticket` values are exchanged on demand with short TTL.
- If sandbox session context is missing or expired, the browser must return to the Redeven web app for re-issuance.

## Reconnect recovery strategy

Env App reconnect recovery is intentionally split into two layers:

1. **Transport fast retries**

   - Flowersec transport reconnect keeps a small bounded retry budget for short websocket/tunnel blips in both remote tunnel mode and local direct mode.
   - This path is optimized for brief network hiccups and quick runtime restarts.

2. **App-level waiting loop**

   - If fast retries are exhausted, Env App switches into an explicit waiting state instead of hammering full reconnect attempts.
   - `EnvAppShell` owns the only waiting coordinator; maintenance and page-level widgets do not start their own reconnect loops.
   - The shell polls runtime availability with a single-flight backoff timer and only launches controlled reconnect probes.
   - Remote mode probes environment status from the control plane.
   - Local direct mode probes Local UI availability plus local access-gate state from `/api/local/access/status`.
   - Manual retries and lifecycle nudges (`online`, `focus`, `visibilitychange`) reuse the same coordinator so the UI never spawns parallel reconnect loops.

3. **Secure-session recovery**
   - Transport recovery and access-gate recovery stay separate.
   - After reconnect, Env App re-checks the secure session authoritatively instead of trusting stale browser-side unlocked state.
   - If the runtime restart invalidates the previous resume token or local access session, the same page switches back to the in-place password prompt without requiring a manual refresh.

UI contract:

- `Connecting to runtime...`
  - initial session establishment
- `Reconnecting to runtime...`
  - transport fast retry or an explicit hard reconnect probe is in flight
- `Waiting for runtime...`
  - prolonged outage / restart window after offline-like failures
- `Preparing secure session`
  - transport is back, but the access-gate password/session resume handshake is still running

Design goals:

- keep transient recovery fast,
- bound control-plane pressure during prolonged downtime,
- distinguish runtime unavailability from secure-session recovery,
- let the same reconnect contract cover remote tunnel mode and local direct mode,
- keep reconnect policy centralized in the Env App shell instead of scattering timers across pages.

## Audit log

There are **two** audit log sources:

1. Redeven service-side session audit log.

   - This is **not** shown in the Env App.
   - It is surfaced in the Redeven web app for environment admins.

2. Runtime-local audit log (user operations): recorded and persisted by the runtime.
   - Env App reads it via the local gateway API (env admin only):
     - `GET /_redeven_proxy/api/audit/logs?limit=<n>`
   - Storage (JSONL + rotation):
     - `<state_dir>/audit/events.jsonl`
     - `state_dir` is the directory of the runtime config file (default: `~/.redeven/`)
   - The log is metadata-only and must not contain secrets (PSK/attach token/AI secrets/file contents).
   - If present, `tunnel_url` is transport routing metadata only. It must not be interpreted as the authorization scope for the session.

## Diagnostics mode

Diagnostics is an infrastructure capability of the local runtime. The floating Debug Console is a frontend-only surface layered on top of that diagnostics stream.

Behavior:

- Runtime-side request/direct-session diagnostics are stored separately from audit logs:
  - `<state_dir>/diagnostics/agent-events.jsonl`
- Desktop builds that attach to the same runtime may also write:
  - `<state_dir>/diagnostics/desktop-events.jsonl`
- Local UI and gateway share a single trace header:
  - `X-Redeven-Debug-Trace-ID`
- Local UI and gateway also expose the runtime collector state through:
  - `X-Redeven-Debug-Console-Enabled`
- Runtime Settings exposes `Debug Console` under the dedicated `Diagnostics` group instead of mixing it into Logging, and the floating console reads data through:
  - `GET /_redeven_proxy/api/debug/diagnostics`
  - `GET /_redeven_proxy/api/debug/diagnostics/export`
  - `GET /_redeven_proxy/api/debug/diagnostics/stream`
- Browser-local rendering telemetry such as FPS, long tasks, layout shifts, and heap usage stays in the Env App shell, starts while the Debug Console is visible, and is merged into the exported debug bundle without being persisted back into the runtime state directory.

The diagnostics stream is timing-focused and must remain separate from the audit log because it is intended for troubleshooting performance and startup issues rather than user-operation auditing.

## Codespaces (code-server) management

The Env App UI manages local codespaces via the local runtime gateway API:

- `GET /_redeven_proxy/api/spaces`
- `POST /_redeven_proxy/api/spaces`
- `POST /_redeven_proxy/api/spaces/:id/start`
- `POST /_redeven_proxy/api/spaces/:id/stop`
- `DELETE /_redeven_proxy/api/spaces/:id`
- `GET /_redeven_proxy/api/code-runtime/status`
- `POST /_redeven_proxy/api/code-runtime/install`
- `POST /_redeven_proxy/api/code-runtime/select`
- `POST /_redeven_proxy/api/code-runtime/default`
- `POST /_redeven_proxy/api/code-runtime/detach`
- `POST /_redeven_proxy/api/code-runtime/remove-version`
- `POST /_redeven_proxy/api/code-runtime/cancel`

When opening a codespace, the Env App mints a one-time ticket for `com.floegence.redeven.code`, then opens:

- `https://cs-<code_space_id>.<region>.<base-sandbox-domain>/_redeven_boot/#redeven=<b64url(init)>`

Notes:

- Codespace/3rd-party app windows never receive `boot_ticket` or `env_session`. They only get one-time `entry_ticket`.
- In normal browser sessions, Env App still uses a pre-opened popup/tab so user-triggered navigation stays within browser popup-blocker rules.
- In Redeven Desktop, Codespaces `Open` does not stay inside Electron. Env App asks the desktop shell bridge to open the final Codespaces URL in the system browser, while keeping the same one-time `entry_ticket` bootstrap contract.
- If the desktop-managed Local UI is password-protected, the first protected Local UI request can still start from a `redeven_access_resume` token. Local UI exchanges that resume token into the standard local access cookie before returning the protected Codespaces page so later same-origin asset requests do not need to keep carrying the token.
- If a codespace window is refreshed after the hash is cleared, it can request a fresh `entry_ticket` from the opener Env App via `postMessage` handshake.
- If the desktop-opened browser window no longer has an opener, the trusted launcher still keeps `?env=` so the existing independent-open recovery flow can redirect back through Portal / Env App bootstrap when needed.
- Codespaces cards also expose right-click `Ask Flower` and `Open in Terminal` actions. `Ask Flower` stays first to match the broader Env App handoff ordering, while `Open in Terminal` opens a terminal session rooted at `workspace_path`. The `Ask Flower` action sends that same `workspace_path` as directory context so the composer keeps the same folder-oriented prompt copy used by File Browser directory launches.
- Codespaces does **not** auto-install `code-server`. When the runtime is missing or unusable, Env App shows an explicit install UI and waits for the user to click `Install and use for this environment` or `Install latest and use for this environment`.
- Runtime Settings -> `Codespaces & Tooling` also exposes a dedicated `code-server Runtime` management card. It separates steady runtime status from transient management activity:
  - when no usable runtime is available, Settings renders a compact installable state instead of a dense `Not detected` table dump,
  - the steady state clearly separates `Current environment`, `Installed on this machine`, and `Recent runtime operation`,
  - users can reuse an installed version for the current environment, set the machine default for new environments, remove only the current environment pin, or remove one machine version when it is safe,
  - while install or machine-version removal is running, Settings switches to a focused operation panel with optional recent output,
  - after a successful install or machine-version removal, Settings returns to the normal steady state instead of leaving a persistent success audit block on screen,
  - failed or cancelled actions keep their recent output visible so the user can recover explicitly.
- The Codespaces install flow displays the same explicit source and progress details inside Env App before the user continues to the pending `Start` or `Open` action.
