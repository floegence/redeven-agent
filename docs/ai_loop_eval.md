# Flower Behavioral Eval Workflow

This document describes the current Flower evaluation workflow in Redeven.

The workflow is gate-first:

1. replay known bad trajectories
2. run a behavioral task suite against the live Flower runtime
3. compare suite metrics against configured baselines
4. block promotion when the hard gate fails

## Entry points

Behavioral suite:

```bash
./scripts/eval_ai_loop_matrix.sh /abs/path/to/target-repo
```

Local-config sandbox suite:

```bash
./scripts/eval_local_config_sandbox_suite.sh /abs/path/to/target-repo
```

Hard-gate suite:

```bash
./scripts/eval_gate.sh /abs/path/to/target-repo
```

`eval_ai_loop_matrix.sh` keeps its historical name for compatibility, but it now runs the single behavioral suite rather than a prompt/loop profile matrix.

`eval_local_config_sandbox_suite.sh` is the dedicated entry point for validating the locally active Flower model configuration. It does not force a provider or model on the command line; instead it uses the current `ai.current_model_id` from local config, so if your current local setup is `moonshot/kimi-k2.5`, the suite runs on that model automatically. The wrapper also disables benchmark baselines by default unless you explicitly provide `BASELINE_PATH`, because this suite is meant for provider-specific local diagnostics rather than the shared open-source promotion gate.

The local-config sandbox suite is also the main end-to-end regression surface for the structured runtime protocol. It intentionally exercises:

- `file.read` for direct repository inspection
- `exit_plan_mode` for readonly plan-to-act escalation
- `write_todos` for multi-step readonly discipline
- `file.write` and `file.edit` for deterministic structured mutations
- `apply_patch` as a compatibility editing path
- workspace-boundary refusal when a task asks for an out-of-scope write

For structured edit and compatibility tasks, verification should be command-backed: the intended success path is mutation via `file.*` or `apply_patch`, then verification via `terminal.exec`, then a user-facing summary with evidence paths.

## Inputs

Environment variables:

- `TASK_SPEC_PATH`
- `BASELINE_PATH`
- `ENFORCE_GATE`

CLI flags from `cmd/ai-loop-eval`:

- `--task-spec`
- `--baseline`
- `--enforce-gate`
- `--min-pass-rate`
- `--min-loop-safety-rate`
- `--min-fallback-free-rate`
- `--min-accuracy`

## Behavioral suite model

The suite is task-centric, not profile-centric.

Each task runs against the real Flower runtime with:

- a real thread execution mode (`act` or `plan`)
- real run knobs (`max_steps`, `max_no_tool_rounds`, `reasoning_only`, `no_user_interaction`, `require_user_confirm_on_task_complete`)
- real runtime policy decisions, including `intent` and `execution_contract`
- real tools and real persisted runtime state

Each task also declares an explicit workspace mode:

- `source_readonly`: reuse the source workspace path directly, but force readonly `terminal.exec` and restrict the visible tool surface to non-mutating tools
- `none`: create an empty task workspace directory for protocol-only tasks that do not need real repository contents
- `fixture_copy`: materialize a small writable task workspace from a dedicated eval fixture tree

Every task still gets its own runtime `state/` directory, and tasks that materialize a workspace do so under the report directory. This keeps task-local workspace boundaries explicit without copying the full source repository for every readonly eval.

## Task spec schema

Tasks are loaded from YAML under `eval/tasks/` and support:

- `stage`
- `category`
- `turns`
- `runtime`
- `assertions.output`
- `assertions.thread`
- `assertions.tools`
- `assertions.events`
- `assertions.todos`

Tool assertions also support `workspace_scoped_tools`, which fails a task when those tool calls contain path arguments that escape the task workspace boundary. Structured file tools (`file.read`, `file.edit`, `file.write`) participate in the same boundary checks as `apply_patch` and `terminal.exec`.

Assertion groups are intentionally structural:

- output: evidence, minimum path count, minimum length, required phrases, forbidden phrases
- thread: final `run_status`, final `execution_mode`, waiting prompt presence
- tools: required tool calls, forbidden tool calls, success requirements, call budget, and workspace-scope safety
- events: required event types, forbidden event types, hard-fail event types
- todos: snapshot presence, non-empty plan, closed plan, in-progress discipline

Runtime-owned signal tools such as `ask_user` and `exit_plan_mode` are expected to appear as normal successful tool-call records in reports so eval assertions can treat them the same way as scheduler-dispatched tools.

Runtime-output invariants worth asserting explicitly:

- a single assistant run should converge to one canonical visible answer, not multiple concatenated final-answer revisions
- draft text from a still-active run must not be replayed into later provider turns as committed assistant history
- `execution_contract` should explain why a run ended directly, promoted into an agentic loop, or persisted into `waiting_user`
- `protocol_closeout` may recover only clean in-band completion; interrupted or canceled runs must never be reported as successful closeout

## Report model

The report is suite-oriented:

- per-task results include output preview, thread state, tool summary, todo snapshot, event counts, evidence paths, and hard-fail reasons
- suite metrics aggregate pass rate, loop safety, recovery success, fallback-free rate, and average scores
- stage metrics aggregate the same metrics for `screen` and `deep`

Artifacts:

- `report.json`
- `report.md`
- `state/`
- `workspaces/` for tasks that materialize a task-local workspace (`none` or `fixture_copy`)

Default output directory:

- `~/.redeven/ai/evals/<timestamp>/`

The local-config sandbox suite writes the same report shape and is intended for provider-specific smoke/regression runs such as "verify my current Kimi setup can inspect the real workspace with file.read, escalate with exit_plan_mode, write safely inside a task-local fixture workspace, preserve apply_patch compatibility, and refuse outside-workspace edits."

## Hard gate

The hard gate compares the suite against:

1. absolute thresholds
2. best metrics across configured baseline sources

Metrics:

- `pass_rate`
- `loop_safety_rate`
- `recovery_success_rate`
- `fallback_free_rate`
- `average_accuracy`

Gate output is written into `report.json` under `gate`.

## Replay validation

`cmd/ai-loop-replay` replays persisted transcripts and rejects known anti-patterns such as:

- fallback final text
- tool-heavy runs without a concrete conclusion
- empty assistant output after structured Flower tool completion

Replay now treats `ask_user` and `task_complete` blocks as valid assistant-visible output when no markdown/text block exists.

Fixtures live in:

- `eval/replay_cases/loop_exhausted_fail.message.log.json`
- `eval/replay_cases/normal_pass.message.log.json`
