# Desktop Shell

This document describes the public Electron desktop shell that ships with each `redeven` GitHub Release.

## Goals

- Keep `redeven` as the single runtime authority for endpoint behavior.
- Ship a desktop installer that bundles the matching `redeven` binary.
- Reuse Redeven Local UI instead of introducing a second app runtime.
- Make machine choice explicit on every cold desktop launch.
- Keep launcher, recovery, diagnostics, and Local Environment configuration aligned around one welcome-first model.

## Architecture

- Electron is a thin shell around Redeven Local UI.
- `redeven run --mode desktop --desktop-managed` remains the only bundled-runtime entrypoint.
- The main BrowserWindow keeps one shell-owned launcher dashboard:
  - `Connect Environment`
- `Local Environment Settings` is a shell-owned dialog layered on top of that dashboard.
- The launcher dashboard and `Local Environment Settings` dialog render inside the same Floe workbench shell instance.
- The shell keeps `Top Bar`, `Activity Bar`, and `Bottom Bar` visible before a machine is opened, so startup and active-session flows share the same frame.
- Every cold desktop launch opens the welcome launcher first.
- The launcher always asks the user what to open in this desktop session:
  - `Local Environment`
  - a remembered recent Environment
  - a newly entered Redeven Local UI URL
- Reopening the launcher from an active session does not immediately disconnect the current target. The current session stays available until the user opens a different Environment.
- Common startup failures return to the launcher with inline context instead of bouncing users to a separate blocked-first flow.
- Electron only allows navigation to the exact reported Local UI origin and opens all other URLs in the system browser.

## Runtime Contract

Desktop packages always start the bundled binary through `redeven run --mode desktop --desktop-managed`.

The base launch shape is:

```bash
redeven run \
  --mode desktop \
  --desktop-managed \
  --local-ui-bind localhost:23998 \
  --startup-report-file <temp-path>
```

Desktop may add user-configured startup flags on top of that base command:

- `--local-ui-bind <host:port>`
- `--password-stdin`
- `--controlplane <url>`
- `--env-id <env_public_id>`
- `--env-token-env REDEVEN_DESKTOP_ENV_TOKEN`

Behavior:

- Local UI always starts for `Local Environment`.
- `--password-stdin` is the non-interactive desktop-managed password transport.
- The Local UI password stays out of process args and environment variables.
- Desktop startup reports and attachable runtime state include a non-secret `password_required` boolean so launcher and attach flows can describe whether the current runtime is protected.
- Remote control is enabled only when the local config is already bootstrapped and remote-valid.
- `--desktop-managed` disables CLI self-upgrade semantics.
- Desktop-owned managed-runtime restart stays available, but it is owned by Electron main rather than runtime self-`exec`.
- Managed restart reuses Desktop-owned startup preferences, including `--password-stdin`, and preserves the current resolved loopback bind when the saved bind uses the advanced auto-port loopback option such as `127.0.0.1:0`.
- `--startup-report-file` lets Electron wait for a structured desktop launch report instead of scraping terminal output.
- On lock conflicts, the runtime first tries to attach to an existing Local UI from the same state directory before reporting a blocked launch outcome.
- Desktop-managed startup settings do not create a separate runtime state directory; `~/.redeven` remains the runtime source of truth.

When the selected target is `Remote Environment`, Desktop does not start the bundled binary.
Instead it validates and probes the configured Local UI base URL, then opens that exact origin in the shell.

### Launch Outcomes

The launch report distinguishes these outcomes:

- `ready`: the spawned desktop-managed process started Local UI successfully
- `attached`: the desktop shell found an attachable Local UI from the same state directory and reuses it
- `blocked`: another runtime instance owns the same state directory, but Desktop cannot attach to a Local UI from it

The first stable blocked code is:

- `state_dir_locked`

That blocked payload includes lock owner metadata and relevant state paths so Desktop can show actionable diagnostics without guessing from stderr text.

## Welcome Launcher

`Connect Environment` is the primary shell-owned startup surface.

Visual hierarchy:

- shell title: `Redeven Desktop`
- shell surface title: `Connect Environment`
- primary workbench column:
  - `Current Session`
  - `Local Environment`
- secondary workbench column:
  - `Environment Library`
  - `Add Connection`
  - `All / Current / Recent / Saved` filters
- activity bar:
  - one item: `Connect Environment`

Interaction rules:

- Cold launch never auto-opens a remembered target.
- Environment choice is always a launcher action, never a side effect of saving settings.
- `Local Environment` is the primary path and behaves like a workbench-style open action.
- `Local Environment Settings` opens as a dialog without replacing the launcher dashboard.
- `Add Connection` opens a dialog that can either connect immediately or save a remote Environment into the library.
- Remote library entries distinguish:
  - the current unsaved remote session
  - auto-remembered recent connections
  - explicitly saved connections
- Recent remote Environments stay one click away after a successful connection.
- Saved remote Environments render in a compact library table and can be opened, edited, or deleted inline.
- Validation errors render inline in the active launcher dialog, while startup failures render inline on the launcher.
- The shell frame remains visible before connection, but the activity bar keeps only the single `Connect Environment` entry.
- The launcher close action means:
  - `Quit` when no environment is open yet
  - `Back to current environment` when a target is already open

## Local Environment Settings

`Local Environment Settings` is a launcher-owned dialog inside the same desktop shell, not a second page or window.

It edits only future startup behavior for `Local Environment`:

- `local_ui_bind`
- `local_ui_password`
- one-shot bootstrap request:
  - `controlplane_url`
  - `env_id`
  - `env_token`

Rules:

- Saving options only persists configuration.
- Saving options does not switch Environments.
- Cancel returns to the current Environment when one is already open; otherwise it returns to Connect Environment.
- One-shot bootstrap data is cleared automatically after a fresh successful desktop-managed start consumes it.
- The Local UI password input is write-only. When Desktop already has a stored password, the field stays blank and blank means `keep the stored password`.
- Removing a stored password requires an explicit remove action. Simply seeing an empty write-only field must not clear the stored secret.
- The dialog starts with a compact summary grid for visibility, next-start address, password state, and next start status.
- The first decision is a visibility intent, not a raw bind field:
  - `Local only`
  - `Shared on your local network`
  - `Custom exposure`
- The UI maps that intent back onto the existing runtime contract (`local_ui_bind` + `local_ui_password`) before saving, but it keeps port selection as a separate control instead of hiding it inside the scope preset.
- The settings dialog also shows the current managed runtime URL separately from the next-start configuration when the local environment is already running.
- The one-shot bootstrap request stays in a compact `Advanced` section so the main settings flow stays focused on common local access decisions.

## Desktop Preferences

Desktop keeps one persisted preference model for stable `Local Environment` configuration and saved remote Environments:

- `local_ui_bind`
- `local_ui_password`
- `local_ui_password_configured`
- `pending_bootstrap`
- `saved_environments`
- `recent_external_local_ui_urls`

Semantics:

- Desktop does not persist a remembered current target for the next launch.
- The active target is runtime-only desktop session state.
- `local_ui_bind`, `local_ui_password`, and `local_ui_password_configured` apply only to future `Local Environment` opens.
- Desktop never sends the stored Local UI password plaintext back to the renderer. The shell UI edits only a write-only replacement draft plus explicit keep/replace/remove intent.
- `saved_environments` stores user-visible labels, normalized Local UI URLs, an origin marker (`saved` vs `recent_auto`), and `last_used_at_ms`.
- `recent_external_local_ui_urls` remains a normalized compatibility bridge derived from `saved_environments`.
- Secrets are stored in Desktop’s local settings files and use Electron `safeStorage` encryption when the host platform provides it; otherwise the files remain local-only user data owned by the current account.

Desktop maps user-facing local-access decisions back onto the same runtime contract:

- Default `Local only` -> `localhost:23998` with no password
- Default `Shared on your local network` -> `0.0.0.0:23998` with a password baseline
- `Custom exposure` -> raw bind/password editing
- Advanced `Local only` may opt into `127.0.0.1:0`, which the UI presents as `Auto-select an available port` instead of surfacing `:0` directly

Desktop semantics:

- Visibility scope and port selection are separate controls.
- `Local only` and `Shared on your local network` share the same fixed default port baseline.
- The saved configuration applies to the next managed start; the currently running managed URL is displayed separately when available.

Target validation rules:

- External targets must use an absolute `http://` or `https://` URL.
- The host must be `localhost` or an IP literal.
- The shell normalizes the configured target to the Local UI origin root.

Desktop shell preferences live under the Electron user data directory, not inside the git checkout.

## Shell-Owned Theme State

Desktop theme is shell-owned UI state shared by Electron main, preload, welcome, and desktop Env App.

Authoritative state:

- Electron main persists `theme_source` in Desktop UI state under `desktop:theme-source`.
- `theme_source` is one of:
  - `system`
  - `light`
  - `dark`
- Electron main resolves `resolved_theme` from `theme_source` plus `nativeTheme.shouldUseDarkColors`.
- Electron main materializes one `DesktopThemeSnapshot` payload:
  - `source`
  - `resolvedTheme`
  - `window.backgroundColor`
  - `window.symbolColor`

Behavior:

- Every `BrowserWindow` is created from the latest shell snapshot, so the native window background is correct before the first renderer paint.
- Linux title bar overlay colors still come from the desktop shell, but that overlay behavior is no longer coupled to renderer-side color reporting.
- Preload exposes `window.redevenDesktopTheme` with synchronous `getSnapshot()`, `setSource(...)`, and `subscribe(...)`.
- Preload applies `html.light` / `html.dark` and `color-scheme` as soon as the document is available, then keeps the current document synchronized when theme updates arrive from Electron main.
- Welcome and desktop Env App route only the Floe `theme` persistence key through the shell bridge; other UI state stays in their normal storage namespaces.
- Theme toggles from either welcome or Env App update native chrome and all registered renderer windows together, including detached desktop child windows.
- When the stored source is `system`, Electron main rebroadcasts a fresh snapshot whenever the OS theme changes.

Non-goals:

- Native window colors must not depend on DOM color sampling from the current page.
- Desktop should not maintain one-off per-surface theme patches for welcome, Env App, or detached child windows.

## User Entry Points

- Cold app launch opens the welcome launcher in the main window.
- The native app menu exposes one primary shell action: `Connect Environment...`
- Shell window aliases such as `connect` route to the same welcome launcher.
- Generic settings aliases such as `advanced_settings` route to `Local Environment Settings`.
- After Local UI opens inside Redeven Desktop, Env App still exposes shell-owned window actions through the desktop browser bridge.
- The desktop browser bridge also exposes a dedicated managed-runtime restart action for `Restart runtime`; it is separate from window-navigation actions.
- The desktop browser bridge also exposes an explicit external-URL action for workflows that must leave the Electron shell and continue in the system browser.
- Env App exposes `Connect Environment` and `Runtime Settings` through the desktop browser bridge when the desktop shell bridge is available.
- Env App Codespaces uses that external-URL bridge when the desktop shell is present, so `Open` launches the selected codespace in the system browser instead of an Electron child window.
- Env App `Runtime Settings` stays separate from shell-owned Environment selection and desktop-managed startup state.

## Error Recovery

- Remote target unreachable
  - launcher reloads with the failing URL preserved and an inline remote-environment issue
- Desktop-managed startup blocked
  - launcher reloads with a `Local Environment` issue and diagnostics copy
- Secondary compatibility surfaces such as the blocked page may still exist, but the normal product flow is launcher-first recovery in the main window

## Accessibility Behavior

Desktop-owned startup surfaces target the same WCAG 2.2 AA baseline as Env App and now reuse Floe workbench layout primitives for shell chrome.

The required contract is:

- Include a skip link and a stable `main` target so keyboard users can bypass window chrome and page preamble.
- Keep launcher validation and surfaced startup issues focusable and announced with alert/live-region semantics.
- Use explicit labels and `aria-describedby` relationships for settings inputs instead of placeholder-only guidance.
- Preserve visible `:focus-visible` treatments on links, buttons, cards, and inputs.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` in page-level CSS.
- Maintain contrast-safe theme tokens when updating desktop palette values.
- Interactive launcher and settings controls must expose a pointer cursor while active.

Desktop-specific outcomes from this implementation:

- The launcher focuses the surfaced issue region when a startup or connection problem is rendered.
- Inline launcher validation errors are focusable and announced immediately.
- The blocked page still focuses its summary alert on load for compatibility.

## Env App Behavior

- Desktop-managed Local UI exposes `desktop_managed`, `effective_run_mode`, and `remote_enabled` through local runtime/version endpoints.
- Env App hides `Update Redeven` in desktop-managed runs.
- Env App keeps `Restart runtime`.
- When a desktop-managed restart finishes, Env App recovers in place through the same shell-owned reconnect/access-gate flow used by other reconnect scenarios.
- If the restarted runtime requires password verification again, the same page asks for the Local UI password instead of requiring a manual browser refresh.
- The maintenance card explains that updates must come from a new desktop release.
- Detached desktop child windows keep using the same Env App runtime, access gate, and Flowersec protocol path; only the shell-owned launcher/options surfaces differ.

## Release Assets

Each public `vX.Y.Z` release includes:

- `redeven_linux_amd64.tar.gz`
- `redeven_linux_arm64.tar.gz`
- `redeven_darwin_amd64.tar.gz`
- `redeven_darwin_arm64.tar.gz`
- `Redeven-Desktop-X.Y.Z-linux-x64.deb`
- `Redeven-Desktop-X.Y.Z-linux-x64.rpm`
- `Redeven-Desktop-X.Y.Z-linux-arm64.deb`
- `Redeven-Desktop-X.Y.Z-linux-arm64.rpm`
- `Redeven-Desktop-X.Y.Z-mac-x64.dmg`
- `Redeven-Desktop-X.Y.Z-mac-arm64.dmg`

Windows is intentionally out of scope for this repository.

## Local Development

Desktop package checks:

```bash
./scripts/check_desktop.sh
```

Node.js `24+` is required for desktop package checks and packaging.

Desktop development and packaging always prepare a deterministic local bundle at:

```bash
desktop/.bundle/<goos>-<goarch>/redeven
```

The standard desktop entrypoints build or refresh that bundle from the current repository automatically:

```bash
cd desktop
npm run start
npm run package -- --mac dmg
```

For release automation, the same preparation script can hydrate the bundle from a prebuilt CLI tarball by setting `REDEVEN_DESKTOP_AGENT_TARBALL`.
