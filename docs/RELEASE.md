# Release Process

This document defines the release process for `redeven-agent`.

## Goals

- Deterministic versioned artifacts (`vX.Y.Z`)
- Verifiable supply chain (`SHA256SUMS` + signature)
- Keyless signing (GitHub OIDC + Cosign)
- Cloudflare package mirror parity with GitHub Release artifacts

## Release trigger

The binary release workflow is `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

It runs automatically when a tag that matches `v*` is pushed.

## GitHub Release artifacts

For each release tag, the workflow publishes:

- `redeven_linux_amd64.tar.gz`
- `redeven_linux_arm64.tar.gz`
- `redeven_darwin_amd64.tar.gz`
- `redeven_darwin_arm64.tar.gz`
- `SHA256SUMS`
- `SHA256SUMS.sig`
- `SHA256SUMS.pem`

All artifacts are uploaded to the GitHub Release for that tag.

## Signature model

`SHA256SUMS` is signed with Cosign keyless mode.

Verification is bound to:

- OIDC issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- Workflow identity regex:
  `^https://github.com/floegence/redeven-agent/.github/workflows/release\.yml@refs/tags/v.*$`

This is the same identity constraint used by `install.sh`.

## Cloudflare package mirror + manifest worker (automatic)

The mirror workflow is `.github/workflows/sync-release-assets-to-r2.yml`.

Trigger conditions:

- `workflow_run` when `Release Agent` completes successfully on `v*` tag pushes (primary auto chain)
- `release` event with type `published` (fallback for externally published releases)
- `workflow_dispatch` for manual re-sync

What it does:

1. Download release assets from GitHub Release.
2. Verify `SHA256SUMS` and Cosign signature.
3. Upload verified assets to Cloudflare R2 path:
   - `agent-install-pkg/<tag>/...`
4. Re-download uploaded files and verify SHA256 parity.
5. Deploy the version-manifest Worker after package mirror verification succeeds.

Manifest endpoint served by Worker:

- URL: `https://version.agent.example.invalid/v1/manifest.json`
- Worker source: `deployment/cloudflare/workers/version-manifest/src/worker.mjs`
- Worker config: `deployment/cloudflare/workers/version-manifest/wrangler.toml`

Manifest fields returned by Worker:

- `latest`
- `recommended`
- `updated_at`
- `source_release_tag`
- `mirror_complete`

### Required repository secrets

- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_ENDPOINT`
- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `CLOUDFLARE_AGENT_PACKAGE_BUCKET`
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`

### Failure handling

If mirror/upload/worker deploy fails:

- Workflow is marked failed.
- Existing manifest Worker deployment remains unchanged.
- GitHub Release tag and assets remain intact.

## Install script delivery

The installer script source of truth is in this repository:

- `scripts/install.sh`

`install.sh` download strategy:

- Primary: GitHub Release assets
- Fallback: Cloudflare package mirror (`agent.package.example.invalid`)

## Install worker deployment (separate from package mirror)

Cloudflare Worker deployment for `example.invalid/install.sh` is managed by **Cloudflare Workers Builds** (GitHub integration), not by GitHub Actions.

Worker files:

- generator: `deployment/cloudflare/workers/install-agent/generate-worker.js`
- generated bundle: `deployment/cloudflare/workers/install-agent/dist/install-worker.mjs`
- wrangler config: `deployment/cloudflare/workers/install-agent/wrangler.toml`

### One-time Cloudflare setup (install worker)

Configure the Worker build in Cloudflare Dashboard:

1. Connect repository: `floegence/redeven-agent`.
2. Set production branch to `release`.
3. Set project root to `deployment/cloudflare/workers/install-agent`.
4. Build command: `node generate-worker.js`.
5. Deploy command: `npx wrangler deploy --config wrangler.toml`.

Also ensure `release` branch exists on origin (run once if needed):

```bash
git push origin origin/main:refs/heads/release
```

This setup ensures merges into `main` do not deploy the install worker.

### Tag-driven install worker rollout (when installer changed)

Use this only when installer/worker source changes need rollout:

```bash
./scripts/publish_install_worker_release_branch.sh vX.Y.Z
```

This force-updates `release` to the tag commit and triggers Cloudflare Workers Builds.

## Local verification example

```bash
# Download from a release page first:
#   SHA256SUMS
#   SHA256SUMS.sig
#   SHA256SUMS.pem

cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate SHA256SUMS.pem \
  --signature SHA256SUMS.sig \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/floegence/redeven-agent/.github/workflows/release\.yml@refs/tags/v.*$' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  SHA256SUMS

sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

## Operational notes

- Keep release tags immutable.
- If a release is bad, publish a new patch tag; do not overwrite existing assets.
- If the workflow identity changes (repo/path/workflow name), update the identity regex in:
  - `docs/RELEASE.md`
  - `scripts/install.sh`
  - `scripts/sync_release_assets_to_r2.sh`
